## Installation

The easiest way to install acorn is with [`npm`][npm].

[npm]: https://www.npmjs.com/

```sh
npm install acorn
```

Alternately, download the source.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ternjs/acorn.git
```

## Components

When run in a CommonJS (node.js) or AMD environment, exported values
appear in the interfaces exposed by the individual files, as usual.
When loaded in the browser (Acorn works in any JS-enabled browser more
recent than IE5) without any kind of module management, a single
global object `acorn` will be defined, and all the exported properties
will be added to that.

### Main parser

This is implemented in `dist/acorn.js`, and is what you get when you
`require("acorn")` in node.js.

**parse**`(input, options)` is used to parse a JavaScript program.
The `input` parameter is a string, `options` can be undefined or an
object setting some of the options listed below. The return value will
be an abstract syntax tree object as specified by the
[ESTree spec][estree].

When  encountering   a  syntax   error,  the   parser  will   raise  a
`SyntaxError` object with a meaningful  message. The error object will
have a `pos` property that indicates the character offset at which the
error occurred,  and a `loc`  object that contains a  `{line, column}`
object referring to that same position.

- **ecmaVersion**: Indicates the ECMAScript version to parse. Must be
  either 3, 5, 6 (2015), 7 (2016), or 8 (2017). This influences support for strict
  mode, the set of reserved words, and support for new syntax features.
  Default is 7.

  **NOTE**: Only 'stage 4' (finalized) ECMAScript features are being
  implemented by Acorn.

- **sourceType**: Indicate the mode the code should be parsed in. Can be
  either `"script"` or `"module"`. This influences global strict mode
  and parsing of `import` and `export` declarations.

- **onInsertedSemicolon**: If given a callback, that callback will be
  called whenever a missing semicolon is inserted by the parser. The
  callback will be given the character offset of the point where the
  semicolon is inserted as argument, and if `locations` is on, also a
  `{line, column}` object representing this position.

- **onTrailingComma**: Like `onInsertedSemicolon`, but for trailing
  commas.

- **allowReserved**: If `false`, using a reserved word will generate
  an error. Defaults to `true` for `ecmaVersion` 3, `false` for higher
  versions. When given the value `"never"`, reserved words and
  keywords can also not be used as property names (as in Internet
  Explorer's old parser).

- **allowReturnOutsideFunction**: By default, a return statement at
  the top level raises an error. Set this to `true` to accept such
  code.

- **allowImportExportEverywhere**: By default, `import` and `export`
  declarations can only appear at a program's top level. Setting this
  option to `true` allows them anywhere where a statement is allowed.

- **allowHashBang**: When this is enabled (off by default), if the
  code starts with the characters `#!` (as in a shellscript), the
  first line will be treated as a comment.

- **locations**: When `true`, each node has a `loc` object attached
  with `start` and `end` subobjects, each of which contains the
  one-based line and zero-based column numbers in `{line, column}`
  form. Default is `false`.

- **onToken**: If a function is passed for this option, each found
  token will be passed in same format as tokens returned from
  `tokenizer().getToken()`.

  If array is passed, each found token is pushed to it.

  Note that you are not allowed to call the parser from the
  callback—that will corrupt its internal state.

- **onComment**: If a function is passed for this option, whenever a
  comment is encountered the function will be called with the
  following parameters:

  - `block`: `true` if the comment is a block comment, false if it
    is a line comment.
  - `text`: The content of the comment.
  - `start`: Character offset of the start of the comment.
  - `end`: Character offset of the end of the comment.

  When the `locations` options is on, the `{line, column}` locations
  of the comment’s start and end are passed as two additional
  parameters.

  If array is passed for this option, each found comment is pushed
  to it as object in Esprima format:

  ```javascript
  {
    "type": "Line" | "Block",
    "value": "comment text",
    "start": Number,
    "end": Number,
    // If `locations` option is on:
    "loc": {
      "start": {line: Number, column: Number}
      "end": {line: Number, column: Number}
    },
    // If `ranges` option is on:
    "range": [Number, Number]
  }
  ```

  Note that you are not allowed to call the parser from the
  callback—that will corrupt its internal state.

- **ranges**: Nodes have their start and end characters offsets
  recorded in `start` and `end` properties (directly on the node,
  rather than the `loc` object, which holds line/column data. To also
  add a [semi-standardized][range] `range` property holding a
  `[start, end]` array with the same numbers, set the `ranges` option
  to `true`.

- **program**: It is possible to parse multiple files into a single
  AST by passing the tree produced by parsing the first file as the
  `program` option in subsequent parses. This will add the toplevel
  forms of the parsed file to the "Program" (top) node of an existing
  parse tree.

- **sourceFile**: When the `locations` option is `true`, you can pass
  this option to add a `source` attribute in every node’s `loc`
  object. Note that the contents of this option are not examined or
  processed in any way; you are free to use whatever format you
  choose.

- **directSourceFile**: Like `sourceFile`, but a `sourceFile` property
  will be added (regardless of the `location` option) directly to the
  nodes, rather than the `loc` object.

- **preserveParens**: If this option is `true`, parenthesized expressions
  are represented by (non-standard) `ParenthesizedExpression` nodes
  that have a single `expression` property containing the expression
  inside parentheses.
